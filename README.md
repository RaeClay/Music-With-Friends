## Welcome to the program.

The purpose of this open source project is to create music in a cooperative environment. Invite your friends to your server and create music together in our *Garage Band* like interface. Create music with up to five other people at a time and save your creations locally, or upload them to our community forums.

## How to use this

***Installation***

Easy as cake. Double click the "installer.exe" file inside of this folder and allow the program to auto-install. After that, you will be shown a window to set up your user account and link the program to your user ID. That way, you can make music with friends.

***Making music with friends***

Never been this easy. All you need to do is press the "start server" button at the top right of your screen, then share the invite code with your friends. Of course, they must have the program installed and be connected to their user ID. As soon as a friend joins the server, a live chat window will pop up so you can talk about your creations. 

If you still find yourself having difficulty connecting with your friends, please refer to the community forums.
